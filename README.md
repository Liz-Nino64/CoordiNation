## Description
The CoordiNation Application is a full-stack web application that enables users to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides functionalities to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as set priorities, and show task statuses. The application uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database, and Handlebars.js as the template engine. In addition, the application includes authentication, environmental variable protection, and deployment on Heroku.
